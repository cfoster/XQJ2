Contains classes which allow <code>XQConnection</code> objects to participate
in distributed transactions.

<p>The XQJ 1.0 Specification supports local case transactions involving a
single data source, but does not provide support for distributed transactions
where a single transaction involves multiple connections to one or more
underlying data sources. A global transaction across multiple data
sources must either commit successfully across all data sources or in the event
of one data source failing to commit, all data sources must be rolled back.</p>

<p>The XQJ2 Specification makes use of the Java Transaction API&trade;
(JTA&trade;) in order to enable <code>XQConnection</code> objects to
participate in distributed transactions. The design of XA transaction
management in the XQJ2 API has been influenced by XA transaction management
that exists in the JDBC API.</p>

<p>
Generally, an application programmer does not have to deal directly with
classes in this package, rather an Application Server should make use of the
classes found here.

<h3>Effects on local transaction management</h3>

<p>While connection objects are participating in distributed transactions,
invoking any of following methods <code>XQConnection</code> methods will cause
an <code>XQException</code> to be thrown:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>setAutoCommit(true)</code></li>
	<li><code>commit()</code></li>
	<li><code>rollback()</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Using XA classes</h3>

<p>The following example shows simple usage of the XA classes.
Keep in mind that the details would be filled in with work using
other data sources. This type of code usually appears within a
transaction manager.</p>

<pre>
// Create an XA data source for making the XA connection.
XAXQDataSource xaDataSource = new AcmeXADataSource();

// Get an XAConnection and get the associated XAResource.
// This provides access to the resource manager.
XAConnection xaConnection = xaDataSource.getXAConnection();
XAResource xaResource = xaConnection.getXAResource();

// Generate a new Xid (this is up to the transaction manager).
Xid xid = ...;

// Start the transaction.
xaResource.start(xid, XAResource.TMNOFLAGS);

// ...Do some work with the database...

// End the transaction.
xaResource.end(xid, XAResource.TMSUCCESS);

// Prepare for a commit.
xaResource.prepare(xid);

// Commit the transaction.
xaResource.commit(xid, false);

// Close the XA connection when done.  This implicitly
// closes the XA resource.
xaConnection.close();
</pre>

<p>Not all XQJ2 implementations are required to support XA functionality.</p>
