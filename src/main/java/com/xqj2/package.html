Contains proposed additions to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225">
XQuery API for Javaâ„¢ 1.0</a>.
<p>
Interface classes often extend existing
<a target="_blank" href="http://xqj.net/javadoc">XQJ interface classes</a>
and do not break the
<a target="_blank" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=225">
XQJ Specification</a>, for instance <code>XQConnection2</code> simply extends
<code>XQConnection</code>, so the user of an XQJ implementation can only make
use of
<a target="_blank" href="http://xqj2.com">XQJ2</a> features by explicitly
casting a standard XQJ object into an XQJ2 instance which has everything the
previous instance had and more, for instance:
</p>

<pre>
  XQConnection xqc = xqds.getConnection();
  XQConnection2 xqc2 = (XQConnection2)conn;

  // or quicker approach ...

  XQConnection2 conn = (XQConnection2)xqds.getConnection();
</pre>

<p>Despite the XQJ2 API being experimental, effort has been made to keep
different versions of XQJ2 compatible between releases.</p>
